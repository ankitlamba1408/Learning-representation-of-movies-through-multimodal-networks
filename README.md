This discuss about the multimodality, multimodal learning , multimodal deep
learning, various algorithms and networks that can used to learn the multimodal data, some
approaches to multimodal deep learning. About some multimodal datasets that can be used
to learn a multimodal network. Some exploratory analysis on the Datasets. Further about the
movie ratings prediction using multimodal data using machine learning regression models,
and multimodal network. Hence about the the results carried out, and conclusions made.
Also about the way all the work done in vizualization using gantt diagram. One can find
the usefull references in the end of the pdf and code for the work in the Intership_Work.ipynb file ... .
